"""
If you have a right triangle that is x units wide and y units tall, then using atan2(y,x) from the math
module finds one of the triangleâ€™s angles. It returns the result in radians. The degrees() function can
convert the result to degrees. Write a program that asks the user to enter a width and a height and
prints out the angle returned by atan2, but in degrees and rounded to one decimal place.

radius = math.atan2(wide, tall)
