"""
This is a very simple billing program. Ask the user for a starting hour and ending hour, both given in
24-hour format (e.g., 1 pm is 13, 2 pm is 14, etc.). The charge to use the service is $5.50 per hour. Print
out the userâ€™s total bill. You can assume that the service will be used for at least 1 hour and never
more than 23 hours. Be careful to take care of the case that the starting hour is before midnight and
the ending time is after midnight
